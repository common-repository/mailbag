Mailbag lets you quickly and easily add MailChimp or Campaign Monitor email forms to your posts or pages with a shortcode.

==Description==

**Dead Simple Email Subscriptions**

Mailbag lets you quickly and easily drop a MailChimp subscription form into your post, page or widget area. Simply add your MailChimp API key, choose a list to subscribe users to, and add a shortcode to your page. Mailbag ships with minimal front-end styles that can be disabled if you'd rather inherit styles from your theme.

Mailbag is super simple by design. If you're looking for a MailChimp plugin with more options, check out the [MailChimp for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/) plugin.
